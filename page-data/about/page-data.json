The CSA represents the students in the Computing Information Systems program at the <a href=\"https://ufv.ca\">University of the Fraser Valley</a> to staff and faculty. The CSA is based in the the Student Computing Center in D Building, where students can stop by, both to do computer-related homework, and to ask for tutoring assistance on various CIS or CS related topics.</p>\n<p>The CSA runs an annual campus fundraiser called the UFV Child’s Play Game-A-Thon. Now one of the larger events on campus, this event alone has raised almost $10,000 total since it started. Proceeds are donated to Child’s Play Charity, who can be found at <a href=\"https://childsplaycharity.org/\">childsplaycharity.org</a>. This event has been growing larger each year, in 2015 we ran the event in the great hall in the SUB with much success.</p>\n<p>The CSA has also been known to collaborate on campus with several other associations to run large campus-wide events. We participate in SUS events, and have collaborated with the BCSA and PSA for both the Casino Royale and Big Bang Event on campus.</p>\n<p>The goal CSA is to fully provide a fun and enjoyable environment for students on campus, to help build a community of like-minded students from all disciplines in the CIS world.</p>\n<h1>Executives</h1>\n<p>The President, Vice President, Finance Officer, Secretary, and Projects Manager positions will be up for election this coming year.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/about","title":"About"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/about"}}}

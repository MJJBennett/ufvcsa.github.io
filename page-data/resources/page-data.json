These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>USB wireless internet receivers</li>\n<li>USB Keyboard &#x26; Mouse</li>\n<li>HDMI to DVI cable</li>\n<li>XInput gamepad (360)</li>\n<li>Micro USB to USB cable</li>\n<li>MicroSD memory card</li>\n<li>USB memory card reader</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the raspberry pi units are property of the CSA, they’re available for students to work with as they wish with the parts and funding we have available.</p>\n<h4>Unit 1</h4>\n<p>Unit 1 currently runs <a href=\"https://retropie.org.uk/\">RetroPi</a>, a collection of emulators for the raspberry pi. This unit is commonly used at UFV events (such as uJoin) and remains set up in the SCC currently.</p>\n<h4>Unit 2</h4>\n<p>Unit 2 currently is sitting unused, waiting for a student with an idea to put it to use!</p>\n<h2>3D Printer</h2>\n<p>Purchased in 2012, the Computing Student Association runs and maintains an Ultimaker Original for use by students on UFV’s Abbotsford campus. Students are able to upload models of their choice and pay an hourly rate of $1 for printer time, with which their model will be printed for them. The cost associated with the print goes towards the rising cost of maintenance for the printer as it ages, as well as the setup time and the time for the print itself. Prints regularly run up for 5-12 hours for moderate sized prints, and availability depends on the demand placed on the printer at any time.</p>\n<p>To have a model printed, please fill out and print the form below and submit it to the student computing center on UFV’s Abbotsford campus, room D224</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20180812124042/http://ufvcsa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3D-Print-form.pdf\">Print Form (PDF)</a></p>\n<h3>Print Gallery</h3>\n<div style=\"display: flex; width: 100%;\"> \n<img src=\"/images/print1.jpg\"\n     alt=\"Snorlax 3D print\"\n     style=\"max-width: 400px; max-height: 400px; margin: 5px;\" />\n<p><img src=\"/images/print2.jpg\"\n     alt=\"Linked rings\"\n     style=\"max-width: 400px; max-height: 400px; margin: 5px;\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/print3.jpg\"\n     alt=\"Glow-in-the-dark robot\"\n     style=\"max-width: 400px; max-height: 400px; margin: 5px;\" /></p>\n</div>\n### Certifications\n<p>Certification can be a good way to show employers your abilities, but beware: many certifications are not recognized industry-wide or are not highly-regarded.</p>\n<p>Networking</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20180812150806/http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/learning_career_certifications_and_learning_paths_home.html\">Cisco Certifications</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20180812150806/http://www.juniper.net/us/en/training/certification/certification-tracks/\">Juniper Certifications</a></li>\n<li>CompTIA Network+</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Operating Systems</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20180812150806/http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-overview.aspx\">Microsoft Certifications</a> –</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20180812150806/http://www.redhat.com/certification/\">Red Hat Certifications</a> –</li>\n<li>CompTIA Linux+</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hardware</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20180812150806/http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/a.aspx\">CompTIA A+ Certification</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Security</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CompTIA Security+</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"path":"/resources","title":"Resources"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/resources"}}}
